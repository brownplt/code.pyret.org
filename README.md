# code.pyret.org

## Simple Configuration

Configuration is controlled through a file called `.env` in the base
directory.  This jives with how Heroku manages configuration variables;
everything in `.env` is just an environment variable if you really want to
manage things yourself, but using Heroku tools makes sure you run like things
do in production.

First, get the [Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).

Then, copy `.env.example` to `.env`.  If all you want to do is run Pyret code
and test out the REPL, you only need to edit a few variables.  If you want to
use the standalone pyret that comes with the checkout, you can just set

```
PYRET="http://localhost:5000/js/cpo-main.jarr"
```

Then you can run

```
$ npm run local-install
$ ln -s node_modules/pyret-lang pyret
$ npm run build
```

and the dependencies will be installed.

To run the server (you can let it running in a separate tab --
it doesn't need to be terminated across builds), run:

```
$ npm start
```

The editor will be served from `http://localhost:5000/editor`.

If you edit JavaScript or HTML files in `src/web`, run

```
$ npm run build
```

and then refresh the page.

## Running with Development Pyret

If you'd like to run with a development copy of Pyret, you can simply symlink
`pyret` elsewhere.  For example, if your development environment has
`code.pyret.org` and `pyret-lang` both checked out in the same directory, you
could just run this from the CPO directory:

```
$ ln -s ../pyret-lang pyret
```

## Configuration with Google Auth and Storage

In order to have share links, saving, and other docs-related functionality
work, you need to add to your `.env` a Google client secret, a client ID, a
browser API key, and a server API key.  You'll copy
`.env.example` to `.env`, and populate several from your dashboard at Google.

At https://console.developers.google.com/project, make a project, then:

- For `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, which are used for
  authenticating users:

       Credentials -> Create Credentials -> OAuth Client Id

  For development, you should set the javascript origins to
  `http://localhost:5000` and the redirect URI to
  `http://localhost:5000/oauth2callback`.

- For `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, which is used in the browser to make certain public
  requests when users are not logged in yet:

       Credentials -> Create Credentials -> API Key -> Browser Key

  Again, you should use `http://localhost:5000` as the referer for development.

## Testing with Selenium

There are tests in `test-util/` and `test/` that use Selenium to script a
browser.

The instructions for setting up Selenium to open Chrome locally are somewhat
platform-specific.  You will need
[chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) to be on
your path.  Then run running:

```
npm install selenium-webdriver mocha
npm run mocha
```

with Selenium and mocha installed and a development server running.  You can
refine this with, e.g.

```
npm run mocha -- -g "errors"
```

to only run the tests in `test/errors.js`.  (The extra `--` are to escape the
portion of the options to pass to the underlying `mocha` command).

Another options to run all the tests on Sauce Labs (https://saucelabs.com).
You can also get a personal free account with unlimited testing if you only
test open-source stuff (which Pyret/CPO are).  Sauce also stores screencasts
and logs of your tests, which can be helpful with debugging.

First, add your sauce username and access key (from your account page at
Sauce) to `.env`:

```
SAUCE_USERNAME="gibbs"
SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY="deadbeef-2671-11e5-a6a1-206a8a0824be"
```

(Not my real access key)

Second, install the Sauce Connect client for your system from
https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/sauce-connect/.  Follow the instructions
for starting the server (the default configuration should work fine), using
the same username and access key, for example, on Ubuntu I run:

```
~/sc-4.3.9-linux32$ ./bin/sc -u gibbs -k deadbeef-2671-11e5-a6a1-206a8a0824be
```

That sets up a tunnel to Sauce Labs, and on the same machine you should now be
able to run:

```
$ heroku local:run ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha
```

To run only a particular file, pass in one of the filenames in `test/`, e.g.

```
$ heroku local:run ./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha test/world.js
```

Check out how `world.js` and `image.js` are written: they look up files from
`test-util/pyret-programs` and run them according to Selenium testers in
`test-util/util.js`.  The best way to test a whole new library is probably to
add a directory here and figure out a good predicate that can be applied
across the files (`runAndCheckAllTestsPassed` is probably a good candidate for
many use cases).

## Setting up your own remote version of code.pyret.org with Heroku:

If you are doing development on code.pyret.org, it can be useful to run it on a remote server (for sharing purposes, etc.). Heroku allows us to do this easily.

### Before you begin:

Make sure you have cloned the code.pyret.org git repository. Then follow the instructions to get it running locally.

The Heroku getting started guide is helpful, but it will be easier if you set things up in the order below
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs

### To run remotely:
1. Make an account at http://heroku.com/ and from a terminal run `heroku login`
2. Navigate to your local code.pyret.org repository in a terminal.
3.	Run `heroku create <appname>`. This will create an app on Heroku linked to your local repository.
4.	Set the config variables found in `.env` (or `.env.example`) on Heroku. You can enter them using `heroku config:set NAME1=VALUE1 NAME2=VALUE2` or in the online control panel. There are 3 config variables you should pay special attention to:
  - add key `GIT_BRANCH`, value should be your branch name
  - add key `GIT_REV`, value should be your branch name
  - change `PYRET` from local host to a URL that points to cpo-main.jarr from build folder. Make sure URL ends in js instead of jarr.
5.	Add a Redis Cloud database using `heroku addons:add rediscloud` or at addons.heroku.com. You will likely have to verify first (enter a credit card), but you shouldnâ€™t actually be charged for the most basic level (but check for yourself!).
6.	Now, still in your code.pyret.org repo, run

        $ git push heroku <localbranch>:master
        $ heroku ps:scale web=1

7.	Now run `heroku open` or visit appname.herokuapp.com.
8.  Tips for redeploy: if you don't see a successful build under heroku webiste's activity tab, but get "everything is up-to-date" when you run `git push heroku <localbranch>:master`, or your build doesn't look up-to-date, you can do an empty commit: `git commit --allow-empty -m "force deploy"`
