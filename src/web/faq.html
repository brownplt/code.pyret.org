<h3>How do we use your Google account?</h3>

<p> We ask for two permissions:</p>

<p><b>(1) View and manage Google Drive files that
you have opened or created with this app.</b> This permission lets us create
files in your Drive, and update those files later.  Also, if in the future we
provide a way for you to directly upload Pyret files and load them into
<code>code.pyret.org</code> from your Drive, you can explicitly grant
permission for this application to view and edit certain files.
</p>

<p><b>(2) Read access to your Google Drive.</b>
Because of issues with Google Drive's interface that we haven't been able to
figure out (<LINK>), we cannot view publicly shared files without asking for
readonly permission to your Drive.  Permission 1, which is all we would like
to require, causes authorization failures when trying to view public files.
</p>

<p> We use client-only authorization (if you're really interested, we use APIs
similar to the ones described in
https://developers.google.com/drive/web/quickstart/quickstart-js), so this
application can only access your data from open pages on our site.  We don't
save any access tokens to our server (we don't even run a server that does
more than serve static files).  </p>

<p> You can always go to <a
href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions?pli=1">https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions?pli=1</a>
and immediately remove all access that we have to your account.  Your programs
and <code>code.pyret.org</code> folder will <em>not</em> be deleted if you do
so, but you can always manually delete the folder and its contents yourself.
</p>


</p>

<h3>Where are things stored in my Drive?</h3>

<p>
We initially make a single folder in your Google Drive, called
<code>code.pyret.org</code>, and store all of your programs there, with the
names you choose for them.  They are all created with you as the owner, and
private to your account.
</p>

<p>
If you <em>share</em> programs, we create a new folder, called
<code>code.pyret.org.shared</code>, and we make a <em>publicly-readable
copy</em> of any programs you share in that directory.  If you delete this
files in this folder, links for those programs you have shared with others
will stop working, but any copies others have made will be theirs to keep.
Each time you share a program, a new copy is created from its current
contents.
</p>

<p> We can only see files that we created, so simply moving another file into
your <code>code.pyret.org</code> collection won’t cause it to show up in our
interface: you need to create the file manually through our editor.  </p>

<p> The listing of programs in this application only looks for the
<code>code.pyret.org</code> folder and its contents, so if you rename or remove
that folder, a new, empty one will be created for you on your next login.</p>
