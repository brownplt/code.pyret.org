<h3>How do we use your Google account?</h3>

<p>code.pyret.org asks for several permissions when you log in:

<ul>

<li><em>Know who you are on Google</em> and <em>View your email address</em>:
The site needs to know your Google identity because this is the only way we've
found to reliably give persistent access to saving to Drive that doesn't expire
and require popping up new windows while you're editing.  </li>

<li><em>Manage your photos and videos</em> and <em>View the photos, videos, and
albums in your Google Drive</em>:  This is used to import images into programs
from your Drive (which can be useful for customizing games, for example).
</li>

<li><em>View and manage your spreadsheets on Google Drive</em>: This enables
importing tables and working with data sources in your Drive.</li>

<li><em>Add itself to Google Drive</em>: This lets you right-click on Pyret
programs in Google Drive and "Open with Pyret."</li>

<li><em>View and manage Google Drive files and folders that you have opened or
created with this app</em>: This lets the editor see, save, publish, and
re-open programs you create.</li>

</ul>


<p> You can always go to <a
href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions?pli=1">https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions?pli=1</a>
and remove all access that code.pyret.org has to your account.
Your programs and <code>code.pyret.org</code> folder will <em>not</em> be
deleted if you do so.  You can always manually delete the folder and its
contents yourself.</p>



<h3>Where are things stored in my Drive?</h3>

<p>
The site initially makes a single folder in your Google Drive, called
<code>code.pyret.org</code>, and stores all of your programs there, with the
names you choose for them.  They are all created with you as the owner, and
private to your account.
</p>

<p>
If you <em>publish</em> programs, the site creates a new folder, called
<code>code.pyret.org.shared</code>, and makes <em>publicly-readable
copies</em> of programs you publish in that directory.  If you delete this
files in this folder, links for those programs you have shared with others
will stop working, but any copies others have made will be theirs to keep.
Each time you publish a program, a new copy is created from its current
contents.
