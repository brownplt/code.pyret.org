<h3>What permissions does code.pyret.org ask for and why?</h3>

<p>code.pyret.org asks for several permissions when you log in:</p>

<ul>

<li><em>Know who you are on Google</em> and <em>View your email address</em>:
The site needs to know your Google identity because this allows us to give
persistent access to saving to Drive that doesn't expire or require popping up
new windows while you're editing.  </li>

<li><em>Manage your photos and videos</em> and <em>View the photos, videos, and
albums in your Google Drive</em>:  This is used to import images into programs
from your Drive (which can be useful for customizing games, for example).
</li>

<li><em>View and manage your spreadsheets on Google Drive</em>: This enables
importing tables and working with data sources in your Drive.</li>

<li><em>Add itself to Google Drive</em>: This lets you right-click on Pyret
programs in Google Drive and "Open with Pyret."</li>

<li><em>View and manage Google Drive files and folders that you have opened or
created with this app</em>: This lets the editor see, save, publish, and
re-open programs you create.</li>

</ul>



<h3>Where are things stored in my Drive?</h3>

<p>
The site initially makes a single folder in your Google Drive, called
<code>code.pyret.org</code>, and stores all of your programs there, with the
names you choose for them.  They are all created with you as the owner, and
private to your account.  There is also a directory called
<code>code.pyret.org.compiled</code> that is used for caching compiled copies
of programs.
</p>

<p>
If you <em>publish</em> programs, the site creates a new folder, called
<code>code.pyret.org.shared</code>, and makes <em>publicly-readable
copies</em> of programs you publish in that directory.  If you delete this
files in this folder, links for those programs you have shared with others
will stop working, but any copies others have made will be theirs to keep.
Each time you publish a program, a new copy is created from its current
contents.
</p>

<h3>How can I remove the access code.pyret.org has to my data?</h3>

<p> You can always go to <a
href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions?pli=1">https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions?pli=1</a>
and remove all access that code.pyret.org has to your account.
Your programs and the created folders will <em>not</em> be
deleted if you do so.  You can always manually delete the folder and its
contents yourself.</p>

<h3>How can I see old versions of my programs?</h3>

<p>
Google Drive automatically stores old versions of your programs as they are
saved (as it does for all files).  You can follow the instructions at <a
href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2409045?hl=en">Google's
answer</a> to manage old versions of files that you may have saved over or
renamed.
</p>


<h3 id="logging">What information is sent back to the Pyret team?</h3>

<p>We collect basic information about your use of code.pyret.org to help us
improve the language and editor, and enable some debugging.  We send back
information about errors, authentication, whether features such as the
type-checker are used, and preferences (such as which mode you choose to
display highlights with).
</p>

<p>
We don't log the contents of your programs by default.
</p>

<h4 id="detailed-logging">Contributing Detailed Information</h4>

<p>If you opt to contribute detailed usage information under the "More" menu
(off by default), we will also receive information about the contents of your
programs and the edits you make.</p>
